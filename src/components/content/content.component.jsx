They first tested the idea in Dokhlam. They tested the idea to see how would India react and they noticed India did not react. And then they carried out the idea again in Ladakh and also I believe in Arunachal Pradesh,” he said."

To that effect, with all roads leading to Goa, let’s hope the Corporation of the City of Panaji’s aggressive drive to fine offenders will lead to better behaviour.
